  # The regex finds all occurrences of ordinal numbers, matching
  # only the "st", "nd", "rd", and "th" portion. The gsub method
  # accepts a block, in which we pass the replacement text using
  # the global regex variable "$&", which represents the matched text.
  # In plain english, we are looking for all occurrences of
  # "st", "nd", "rd", and "th" that are preceded by a number, and then
  # we replace them with "<sup>#{the text that was matched}</sup>".
  # "content_tag(:sup, $&)" is Rails shorthand for "<sup>#{$&}</sup>".
  #
  # For security purposes, in case the original string contains malicious
  # content, such as a <script>, we first apply the Rails html_escape method,
  # which converts "<" and ">" to "&lt;" and "&gt;", hence preventing any
  # scripts from actually running. Then, once we add the <sup> tags to our
  # safe string, we can declare this new string to be html_safe, since the
  # only html we are not escaping are the <sup> tags, and what's in between
  # the tags is controlled by us.
